# find soh
# use "find" to look in the "soh" directory
# this ensures we don't try to format stuff in the submodules
#
# -type f
# only look for files
#
# -name "*.c" -o -name "*.cpp"
# find all .c and .cpp files
#
# -name "*.h" ! -path "soh/src/**.h" ! -path "soh/include/**.h"
# find all .h files that aren't in soh/src or soh/include
# this is because zret decomp only runs clang-format on c files

# use xargs to take each path we've found
